# Java_TcpAndUdpCalculator

NOTE: For full details on project requirements, please see the "ProgrammingAssignment2.pdf" file included in the upload.

In short, this program takes command line arguments from a cient application, performs those operations on the server, and sends the result back to the client. This was the final assignement in one of my networking courses, and it serves to demonstrate my proficiency in sending packets via TCP and UDP connections. For a project demonstrating similar proficiencies with a more complicated purpose, please view my "Java_GymManagementSystem" repository.
